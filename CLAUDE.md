# Project Documentation Guide

## Philosophy: Empathetic Efficiency
1. Respect the Reader: We value our users' and contributors' time. Documentation should be as short as possible while remaining fully helpful.
2. Warm but Concise: Being "minimal" isn't about being robotic; it’s about being clear. Write like a helpful peer, not a textbook.
3. Welcome Everyone: Make it easy for newcomers to jump in. Directness is our way of reducing the barrier to entry.

## Tone & Style
1. Voice: Use a collaborative, first-person-plural voice ("We use..." or "Let's build...").
2. Clarity over Cleverness: Avoid jargon or complex metaphors. Use simple words to explain complex ideas.
3. Information Density: Every sentence must move the reader forward. If it doesn't explain "how" or "why," it’s fluff.
4. Emojis: Emojis are okay but must be used sparingly and intentionally 🙂.


## Documentation Standards
1. Atomic Updates: Documentation and code are one. If a PR changes logic, it must update the relevant .md files in the same commit.
2. Scannability: Use lists, bold text, headers, and tables when appropriate. Scannability is a gift to the reader.
3. No Marketing: Skip the "game-changing" or "powerful" adjectives. Let the utility of the tool provide the excitement.

## Community & Contributions
1. Be Kind: Feedback should be direct and actionable, never condescending.
2. Minimal Friction: If a contributor's documentation is too wordy, help them trim it down politely rather than rejecting it.
